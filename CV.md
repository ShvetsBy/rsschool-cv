## About
Want to learn Java Script to be more independent. In global sense I want to have an opportunity to work in IT–company in Belarus or abroad after Belorussian trash in 2020. Also in practical sense the JS skills can help me to be a full-stack editor, and do freelance projects without external suppliers.

I'm an editor at Right Design Studio and do some freelance stuff. My work is about gathering an information, making it structure clear and finding the proper formats. I play different roles in editorial process. Find topics and formats as an editor, write text as an author, do design and layout in small projects and run project management, where is it necessary.

Hobbies: crossfit, art, football, fashion and cars.

## Skills
- Advanced typography and basic design.
- Writing in short and clear style.
- Speed reading.
- Figma и Sketch.
- Bootstrap framework, HTML и CSS basics.

## Code example
A small example just to show, that I can write code section with Markdown.
```
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row nopadding">
      <div class="hidden-sm col-md-4 col-lg-4 hidden-xs">
        <h3 class="title">Второго такого букета не будет</h3>
        <p class="text">Мы&nbsp;собираем букеты под заказ и&nbsp;не&nbsp;повторяем работы, поэтому букет будет новым и&nbsp;интересным каждый раз.</p>
        <p class="description">Букет сделан из&nbsp;гортензии, протеи, пионов, матиолы, лизиантуса, фрезии и&nbsp;эвкалипта. Букет заказывали в&nbsp;подарок маме, он&nbsp;стоил 90 рублей.</p>
